A. If Alice’s computer reset and then resumed encryption this can result in vulnerabilities to a Cold Boot attack. This is 
   an attack where the attacker has physical access to the computer and accesses data within the RAM after an immediate restart; 
   this is due to data within the RAM being gradually removed on shutdown instead of all at once. Within our program this can 
   expose our Key.txt file which would completely compromise our encryption. Given access to the Key.txt file an attacker would 
   be able to easily decipher our messages by XORing the cipher with the key: cipher XOR key = plaintext. 
B. There are a couple ways to mitigate this vulnerability. One simple way is to not store the Key.txt file at all; if we 
   generate the key bit by bit and XOR this with the plaintext as it is generated we do not need to store Key.txt and can avoid 
   this vulnerability. If the key does need to be stored, we can use a secure internet connection to store the key without it 
   ever needing to be put in our RAM.
