A.
As with any stream cipher, the twotime pad vulnerability is present. This vulnerability is only made possible when
the keystream is reused. Stream ciphers encrypt by XOR'ing the keystream with the plaintext. In Alice's case, since she is 
restarting the encryption process wwith the same parameters will recreate the same keystream bytes. If an attacker had access to her
device, and finds consecutive ciphertexts, the attacker can XOR the ciphertexts to find the result of the plaintext XOR'ed with 
the keystream.

B.
To prevent this attack from being possible, the parameters used to generate the keystream should be dynamic/one-time use. For each
encryption cycle, the nonce should be randomly generated. Ultimately, the nonce being unique and unpredictable will prevent this attack.
Nonce's can be generated locally using the openssl/rand.h component or some web API that returns random bytes.
